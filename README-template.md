## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

So thinking through this, I can put all of my html and js on page that would be simple then loop through the .json file and record each response. I step up would be to save results of each test so they can view all of them at once and save the data for a up to a month so if the person comes back they can see if they beat the score and or just view old results again.


If I'm going to do the step up the best thing for me to do is seperate the components, home then quiz file then the results which needs to be saved could be a new file. The best tool I know for this is React as they deal with separate components.
